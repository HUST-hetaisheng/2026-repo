\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}

DWTS (Dancing with the Stars) is a popular television competition where celebrity contestants are paired with professional dancers to compete in weekly dance performances. Elimination and advancement results are determined by combining judges' scores and audience votes. The judges assess technical proficiency, which can be subjective, while fan votes are influenced by factors such as celebrity popularity and charisma. As a result, the competition's outcomes have often sparked discussions and controversies, despite the show's attempts to improve the integration of these two elements. In recent years, with increasing audience concerns about fairness in competitive variety shows, DWTS faces a critical need for a fair, impartial, and effective scoring system. This system must ensure both the program's entertainment value and the confidentiality of fan votes, securing a balance between professionalism and popularity. This is essential for DWTS to maintain its viewership and grow its brand in future seasons.

\subsection{Restatement of the Problem}

Given the background information and available data, this study addresses the following tasks.

\textbf{Task 1: Fan Vote Estimation.}\quad
A mathematical model is developed to estimate weekly fan vote totals for each contestant using judges’ scores, elimination outcomes, and contestant data. The model’s consistency is evaluated by its ability to reproduce observed weekly eliminations, and the uncertainty of the estimated fan votes is quantified and analyzed across contestants and weeks.

\textbf{Task 2: Comparison of Vote Combination and Elimination Rules.}\quad
Using the estimated fan votes, the rank-based and percentage-based methods for combining judges’ scores and fan votes are compared across seasons. The effects of alternative elimination procedures, including judges selecting from the bottom two contestants, are also evaluated, leading to a justified recommendation for future seasons.

\textbf{Task 3: Impact of Contestant and Partner Characteristics.}\quad
The impacts of professional dancer traits and celebrity characteristics on competition outcomes are analyzed, with a comparison of their influences on judges’ scores and fan votes.

\textbf{Task 4: Alternative Scoring System.}
An alternative scoring system combining \quad
judges’ scores and fan votes is proposed and evaluated to determine whether it improves fairness or other aspects of the competition.

\section{Model: Inverse Estimation of Fan Votes}

\subsection{Data Preparation and Notation}
Let $J_{i,t}$ be contestant $i$'s total judges score in week $t$ (sum of available judges; missing values ignored).
The data use $0$ as a placeholder after elimination, so the active set is
\begin{equation}
A_t=\{i: J_{i,t}>0\}.
\end{equation}
We treat the last positive score week as the primary elimination signal:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{exit}(i)=\max\{t: J_{i,t}>0\}.
\end{equation}
The \texttt{results} text is used only to flag \texttt{Withdrew} cases, while finals ranking is taken from the native
\texttt{placement} column (complete for all contestants).

We estimate weekly fan vote \emph{shares}
\begin{equation}
v_{i,t}\ge 0,\qquad \sum_{i\in A_t} v_{i,t}=1,
\end{equation}
and define judge shares $j_{i,t}=J_{i,t}/\sum_{k\in A_t}J_{k,t}$. Let $E_t\subseteq A_t$ be the vote-determined
eliminated set (excluding \texttt{Withdrew}) and $S_t=A_t\setminus E_t$.

\subsection{Regime Overview}
The competition uses three different rules:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{S1--2 (Rank)}: combined rank = judge rank + fan rank; the worst sum is eliminated.
\item \textbf{S3--27 (Percent)}: combined score = judge share + fan share; the smallest sum is eliminated.
\item \textbf{S28--34 (Bottom2 + judges' save)}: bottom two by combined rank; judges choose whom to eliminate.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/rules_of_score_combining_and_couple_elimination.png}
    \caption{Enter Caption}
    \label{fig:placeholder}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Regime A: Percent Seasons (S3--27)}
\paragraph{Goal.} Infer $v_{i,t}$ so that eliminated contestants are in the bottom-$|E_t|$ by combined score
$c_{i,t}=j_{i,t}+v_{i,t}$.

\paragraph{Hard consistency constraints.} For each elimination week,
\begin{equation}
c_{e,t}-c_{p,t}\le s_t,\qquad \forall e\in E_t,\ \forall p\in S_t,
\label{eq:percent_hard}
\end{equation}
with slack $s_t\ge 0$ to absorb ties and special episodes. If $E_t=\varnothing$, no ordering constraint is imposed.

\paragraph{Two-stage convex optimization.} Consistency is prioritized via a two-stage solve:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Stage 1 (feasibility):} minimize $s_t$ subject to Eq.~\eqref{eq:percent_hard} and the simplex constraint.
\item \textbf{Stage 2 (tie-break):} restrict $s_t\le s_t^\star+\varepsilon$ and minimize
\begin{equation}
\beta\,\mathcal{L}(\bm v_t)-\alpha\sum_{i\in A_t}v_{i,t}\log v_{i,t},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}$ is a softmax negative log-likelihood for multi-elimination weeks:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\bm v_t)=\tau\sum_{e\in E_t}c_{e,t}+|E_t|\,\log\!\left(\sum_{i\in A_t}e^{-\tau c_{i,t}}\right).
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
This preserves the elimination rule while selecting a neutral, high-entropy solution within the feasible set.

\paragraph{Finals and no-elimination weeks.} For the final week, we enforce the ranking order
$c_{\pi(1),T}>c_{\pi(2),T}>\cdots$ using \texttt{placement}. For no-elimination weeks,
we interpolate $v_{i,t}$ from adjacent weeks with the same active set, avoiding unrealistic uniform or
judge-equals-fan assumptions.

\subsection{Regime B: Rank Seasons (S1--2)}
Let $r^J_{i,t}$ be the judge rank (1=best). Fan ranks $r^F_{i,t}$ must form a \emph{permutation} of
$\{1,\ldots,|A_t|\}$. The combined rank is
\begin{equation}
c_{i,t}=r^J_{i,t}+r^F_{i,t},
\end{equation}
and eliminated contestants are those with the largest $c_{i,t}$.
We construct a feasible permutation by assigning the worst fan ranks to eliminated contestants and
the best fan ranks to contestants with weak judge ranks, then perform swaps to satisfy the elimination constraint.
If no permutation makes all eliminated contestants the worst, we label the week as an \emph{upset}.
Fan ranks are mapped to vote shares by
\begin{equation}
v_{i,t}=\frac{\exp(-\lambda(r^F_{i,t}-1))}{\sum_{p\in A_t}\exp(-\lambda(r^F_{p,t}-1))}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Regime C: Bottom2 + Judges' Save (S28--34)}
The bottom two are the contestants with the two highest combined ranks.
In single-elimination weeks, the partner $b$ in the bottom two is unobserved.
We enumerate each $b\in A_t\setminus\{e\}$, assign fan ranks to make $\{e,b\}$ the bottom two
while keeping the remaining ranks aligned with judges, and choose the feasible candidate with minimal deviation.
If no candidate yields a feasible bottom-two pair, we relax the constraint and record the week accordingly.
Multi-elimination weeks in this regime fall back to the rank-permutation construction.

\subsection{Validation and Certainty}
\paragraph{Consistency.} We compute a \textbf{constraint satisfaction rate} (CSR): the fraction of elimination weeks
whose inferred votes reproduce the observed elimination rule.

\paragraph{Certainty.} We perturb only active judge scores ($J_{i,t}>0$), re-solve the model, and compute
\begin{equation}
\text{Certainty}(i,t)=\frac{1}{1+\text{CV}(i,t)}=\frac{\mu_{i,t}}{\mu_{i,t}+\sigma_{i,t}},
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{i,t}$ and $\sigma_{i,t}$ are the ensemble mean and standard deviation of $v_{i,t}$. The reported
results below use $K=5$ ensemble runs for tractable runtime.

    \EndIf

    \State Validate eliminations and compute CSR.
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Model Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Consistency with Eliminations}
Table~\ref{tab:csr} shows the CSR by regime. Percent seasons achieve 100\% consistency by construction
of hard constraints. Bottom2 seasons remain below 100\% because the bottom-two partner is unobserved
and some weeks require relaxed constraints.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Constraint Satisfaction Rate by Regime}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Regime} & \textbf{Seasons} & \textbf{CSR} \\
\midrule
Rank & 1--2 & 100.0\% \\
Percent & 3--27 & 100.0\% \\
Bottom2 & 28--34 & 79.7\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:csr}
\end{table}

\subsection{Certainty of Estimated Fan Votes}
Average certainty by regime is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:certainty}. Percent seasons are most constrained,
while Bottom2 seasons are least certain because the judges' save introduces additional ambiguity.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Average Certainty by Regime (K=5 Ensemble)}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Regime} & \textbf{Avg Certainty} & \textbf{Interpretation} \\
\midrule
Rank & 0.965 & High (permutation ambiguity) \\
Percent & 0.984 & Very high (hard constraints) \\
Bottom2 & 0.835 & Moderate (unknown partner + judge save) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:certainty}
\end{table}

\subsection{Certainty Variation by Week Type}
Certainty is not uniform across week types. Table~\ref{tab:weektype_certainty} reports the mean certainty
for contestant-week observations by week type.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Certainty by Week Type}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Regime} & \textbf{Week Type} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Avg Certainty} \\
\midrule
Percent & single\_elim & 1391 & 0.986 \\
Percent & no\_elim\_interp & 318 & 0.988 \\
Percent & multi\_elim\_2 & 200 & 0.969 \\
Percent & multi\_elim\_3 & 6 & 0.901 \\
Percent & finals & 82 & 1.000 \\
Bottom2 & single\_elim & 370 & 0.824 \\
Bottom2 & bottom2\_relaxed & 108 & 0.818 \\
Bottom2 & no\_elim\_interp & 108 & 0.826 \\
Bottom2 & multi\_elim\_2 & 85 & 0.851 \\
Bottom2 & finals & 31 & 1.000 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:weektype_certainty}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
Multi-elimination weeks are the most uncertain due to tighter ordering requirements, while finals weeks are most
stable because the ranking constraint is strong and the active set is small.

def selection_sort(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):

This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. \href{https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/}{The time complexity of this algorithm is O($n^2$)}.

There are many other sorting algorithms available such as bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and more. Each of these algorithms has its own advantages and disadvantages. You can learn more about them on GeeksforGeeks and Programiz.

    T = [np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k / n) * odd[k] for k in range(n // 2)]
    return [even[k] + T[k] for k in range(n // 2)] + [even[k] - T[k] for k in range(n // 2)]
\end{lstlisting}
The FFT is a widely used algorithm for computing the \textbf{Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)} of a sequence. It reduces the number of computations needed from O(n$^2$) to O(n log n) 12. The basic idea of the FFT is to apply divide and conquer. We divide the coefficient vector of the polynomial into two vectors, recursively compute the DFT for each of them, and combine the results to compute the DFT of the complete polynomial 3.

I hope this helps!
